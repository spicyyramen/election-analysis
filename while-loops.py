# while loops test if a condition is true
    #if condition is true, then code will perform a task

    #two parts
        # 1 - condition that is tested for true or false value
        # 2 - statement(s) that are repeated as long as the condition is true


#initialize variable x at 0
x=0
# set condition 
while x<=5:
    #statement that is repeated as long as condition is met
    print(x)
    ## adds 1 to x after each print
    x=x+1
